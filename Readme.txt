SnowedIn Demo by Ahmet Emre AYDIN

There are two different cellular automata algorithms available in the demo.
The first one is the Conway's Game of Life.
The second one is a procedural cave generation.

It's created using Unity therefore there is no need to build again.
Run Build.exe in the Build folder to run the demo.

Inputs:
C --- Change between the two algorithms.
Space --- During the cave generation algorithm a new map can be generated.

PS: As full disclosure, I finished the tutorial on Cave generation that
referenced above two months ago. So on top of that, I decided to implement
the Conway's Game of Life algorithm.
